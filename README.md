# Simple UDP Client Server Calculator

## Usage
### Start the Server

```bash
node server.js
```


### Start the Client
in a separate Terminal, run the client with 3 arguments (number operator number):

```bash
node client.js 1 + 1
```

Note: The command line tool does not accept `*` as an argument, use `x` for multiplication instead.
